                    Welcome to the first monthly-edition of breadcrumbs (and my first blog entry!). Hopefully I haven’t caught you stalking and you are simply reading this in a timely fashion 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a mission to start adding life to each day and appreciating the little things all around us, I’ve started to take note of a few “breadcrumbs” of joy, pleasure, satisfaction, pieces of advice, or intriguing thoughts synthesized into a monthly breadcrumbs blog
                </p>
                <p>
                    August of 2025 has been filled with endless goodbyes and hellos. I started as a freshman studying computer science at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign. I’ve had to say goodbye to my high school friends, my favorite childhood book that lives on my nightstand, and my mom’s cooking. At the same time, I’ve said hello to new opportunities, people, classes, and dining hall food. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, this has created a mountain of stress. I’ve constantly been asking myself, “how do I optimize my college experience?”, whether that’s trying to graduate early, take the hardest classes, secure employment, make the best memories, I want it all. It’s moments like these where I struggle to find the smaller breadcrumbs of joy, but nonetheless here are my breadcrumbs for August 2025 
                </p>

                <strong>The perfect seal on my swim goggles: </strong>
                <p>
                    In September I have my very first triathlon, so that means lots of working out across varying disciplines. When I was younger I was repulsed by water, I had a fear of drowning and I refused to even go in a shallow body of water. Since then, I’ve learned how to swim and challenged myself to get more comfortable in the water. Recently, I did a long swimming workout and for the full hour I never had to take off my goggles to defog or drain water out of them. I was able to achieve the perfect seal and everything seemed to click in place.

                <strong>My airpods seamlessly switching between my laptop and phone:  </strong>
                <p>
                    One day I was listening to music on my laptop working in the library (don’t ask me what work I was doing during the welcome week of college…) and suddenly my dad calls me. As I reach to pick up my phone, I forget that I was listening to music. Like magic, the music pauses and the airpods switch to my phone just in time for me to hear my dad. Now I’m not scared that my laptop will suddenly start blasting my music if I disconnect my airpods, yay!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, I’ve only been able to salvage two breadcrumbs for the month (rookie numbers). Do not worry though I have a solution, I’ve started a notes list of the random and small breadcrumbs I encounter so September’s blog post will feature many more breadcrumbs described in excruciating detail (hopefully with some pictures too!)

                    See ya soon!
                </p>

                <strong> Honorable mention: creating this blog!</strong>
                <p> 
                    This is a little too big to be a breadcrumb, so we can call it a loaf of banana bread. Honestly the best thing I’ve done this month is commit myself to creating this blog, writing articles, and documenting my journey through life. At one point I was considering creating a Substack but I fear of becoming obsessed with views, likes, shares, and other statistics of validation. Instead, if you like this blog send me a text or email (rheats2@illinois.edu) to encourage me or suggest me some ideas for future blog posts! I encourage all of you to create your own monthly documentation of breadcrumbs
